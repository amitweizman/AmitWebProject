        <h3>Most succesful apps on Google Play</h3>
        <p>
            We all use apps on a daily basis, and I personley very interested in them, so I decided to do this project about the most succesful apps
            on Google Play, the Android version of App Store.
        </p>
        <p>
            My data base contains lots of useful information about these apps, such as their category, their rating, type, price and more.
            The subject is so interesting for me because I want to learn some day how to make apps and I want to try and learn what makes them succesful
            and help other app developers.
        </p>
